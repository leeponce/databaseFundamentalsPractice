BVC Tech Skills Training Class Projects
1) Either create a dataset or search for a small dataset in the internet.
Use the commands you learned in Data Definition Language (DDL) to practice creating database tables, altering the tables, and dropping, deleting, and truncating the table using your dataset. 
Then, use Data Manipulation Language (DML) to practice inserting data, updating data, selecting information and displaying specific columns in the database. 
Present your work to class.
2) Find or create a dataset with min. 25 records. 
 Break the dataset to two tables and create the structure for the two tables in SQL by using CREATE command. 
 Use SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE commands to populate each of the two tables. 
Join the two tables by using the following commands:
INNER JOIN, 
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
RIGHT OUTER JOIN
FULL OUTER JOIN
3) Then use UNION, INTERSECT and EXCEPT to see how they differ from the JOIN operation.
 Present your results to class.
